<p> GRT is so thrilled to have amazing feedback from our clients!</p>

<p class="review1">"Boo and Ruby are golden retrievers and leash pulling was a problem and we needed help with using correct commands. Drew and Nate were helpful in teaching us and our dogs wha works.  We now use leash commands that are best for the situations, and everyone is much happier!" --Kristy H.</p>

<p class="review2">"Really happy with our leash training for our golden retriever who used to excessively pull!  Happy to say my son took her for a walk today with no issues!" --Melaini J.</p>

<p class="review3">"Our six month old Golden doodle loves Drew and Nate! We recommend GRT because they will take the time to teach the owner how to continue the training at home.  They are very patient and we can tell they really love our baby Leo!" --Megan W.</p>

<p class="review4">My Lab puppy and I couldn't recommend GRT any higher! You can trust they'll treat your dog like one of their own.  The trainers knowledge, patience and techniques have completely refocused and brought out the best in my dogs personality with a night and day difference in place, extended stay commands, heel work, and recall." --Whitney F</p>
